I am a postdoctoral researcher in AI at the Technical University of Munich, hosted at the Chair of Resource-Aware Machine Learning led by [Suvrit Sra](https://mcml.ai/research/groups/sra/). I received my PhD in Mathematics from the University of British Columbia, where my research focused on projection methods and I was fortunate to be advised by [Heinz Bauschke](https://cmps-people.ok.ubc.ca/bauschke/) and [Xianfu Wang](https://cmps.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/shawn-xianfu-wang/).  


My current work studies nonconvex and constrained optimization models underlying modern learning systems, with particular interest in variational formulations, algorithmic stability, and interpretability. I am motivated by applications in scientific machine learning, mathematical problem solving, and hybrid continuous–discrete models.
