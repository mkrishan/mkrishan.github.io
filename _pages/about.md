I am a postdoctoral researcher in AI at the Technical University of Munich, based at the [Chair of Resource-Aware Machine Learning](https://mcml.ai/research/groups/sra/). I received my PhD in Mathematics from the University of British Columbia.

These days, I am learning about deep learning from a foundational perspective. I am grateful to the mentors, advisors, and students I have had the opportunity to learn from and work with.

I will be applying in the 2026–27 job market and am open to senior research positions in AI, both in academia and in industry labs.
