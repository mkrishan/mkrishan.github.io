I am a postdoctoral researcher in AI at the Technical University of Munich, based at the Chair of Resource-Aware Machine Learning, led by [Suvrit Sra](https://mcml.ai/research/groups/sra/). I received my PhD in Mathematics from the University of British Columbia, where I learned about projection methods and variational analysis. I was fortunate to be advised by [Heinz Bauschke](https://cmps-people.ok.ubc.ca/bauschke/) and [Xianfu Wang](https://cmps.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/shawn-xianfu-wang/).

These days, I am learning and working on variational and constrained formulations for learning, sampling, and inference, with an emphasis on structure and stability. I am particularly interested in settings with long horizons, multiple solution paths, and mixed representations, especially in scientific, generative, and reasoning-oriented systems.
